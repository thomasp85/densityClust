\title{Estimate the distance cutoff for a specified neighbor rate}
\usage{
estimateDc(distance, neighborRateLow = 0.01, neighborRateHigh = 0.02)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance}{A distance matrix}

\item{neighborRateLow}{The lower bound of the neighbor rate}

\item{neighborRateHigh}{The upper bound of the neighbor rate}
}
\value{
A numeric value giving the estimated distance cutoff value
}
\description{
This function calculates a distance cutoff value for a specific distance
matrix that makes the average neighbor rate (number of points within the
distance cutoff value) fall between the provided range. The authors of the
algorithm suggests aiming for a neighbor rate between 1 and 2 percent, but
also states that the algorithm is quite robust with regards to more extreme
cases.
