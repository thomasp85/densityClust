Description: An improved implementation (based on k-nearest neighbors) of the 
    density peak clustering algorithm, originally described by Alex Rodriguez 
    and Alessandro Laio (Science, 2014 vol. 344). It can handle large datasets
    (> 100, 000 samples) very efficiently. It was initially implemented by 
    Thomas Lin Pedersen, with inputs from Sean Hughes and later improved by 
    Xiaojie Qiu to handle large datasets with kNNs.
