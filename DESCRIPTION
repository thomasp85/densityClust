Description: An improved implementation (based on k-nearest neighbors) of
    the density peak clustering algorithm, originally described by Alex
    Rodriguez and Alessandro Laio (Science, 2014 vol. 344) <DOI:
    10.1126/science.1242072>.  It can handle large datasets (> 100, 000
    samples) very efficiently. It was initially implemented by Thomas Lin
    Pedersen, with inputs from Sean Hughes and later improved by Xiaojie
    Qiu to handle large datasets with kNNs.
