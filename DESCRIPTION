Description: This package implements the clustering algorithm described by Alex
    Rodriguez and Alessandro Laio (Science, 344 (6191), 1492-1496), and
    provides tools to inspect and visualize the results. The input data
    for the algorithm is a distance matrix so that the user is free to define
    arbitrary distance measures that fit their data or use the dist() function
    provided by the stats package.
