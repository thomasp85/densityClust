Description: An improved implementation (based on k-nearest neighbors) of the 
    density peak clustering algorithm, originally described by Alex Rodriguez 
    and Alessandro Laio (Science, 2014 vol. 344) <DOI: 10.1126/science.1242072>. 
    It can handle large datasets (> 100, 000 samples) very efficiently. It was 
    initially implemented by Thomas Lin Pedersen, with inputs from Sean Hughes 
    and later improved by Xiaojie Qiu to handle large datasets with kNNs.
